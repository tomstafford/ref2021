Each institution and each Unit of Assessment is represented by a square scaled by the number of staff, and coloured according to the overall GPA (a number 1-4 indicating the quality of research according to this exercise). Hot colours (yellows) are numbers nearer 4.

Here is Oxford, the institution which submitted the most staff to REF2021

Every other institution submitted fewer research staff, so they are represented by smaller squares. Here is the University of Sheffield

22 institutions submit >1000 researchers to the REF. Most of the 158 institutions are much smaller. Here is one, Sheffield Hallam University
